# Maze
Created for Processing, a flexible sketchbook similar to Java, this is a game featuring a maze, 
a controllable character, collectible points, an enemy, and an endpoint. The objective of the game
is to collect as many points as possible before heading to the safe point, while avoiding the enemy
the entire time, which will be chasing the controllable character.
